                <ol>
                    <li>Begin with the bench set at a 30 to 45 degree incline. The higher the end of that range, the more you will target your upper pecs and shoulders.</li>
                    
                    <li>Sit at the end of the bench with the dumbbels on your knees. Lean back on the nech and lift the dumbbells over the chest by alternatively lkicking your knees up to help you.</li>
                    
                    <li>Have your feet planted on the floor, core enganged and arms locked out with the dumbbels directly above the upper chest</li>

                    <li>Slowly lower the elbows into an arrows shape just below your shoulder so that you get a big stretch across the chest. Keep the dumbbells an equal distance the entire rep and dont let them move further apart</li>

                    <li>Pause for a second before pushing the weight explosively away from you, back to your starting position as you exhale, ready to repeat</li>

                <h2>Cable Flys</h2>
                <p>If you can, drag the bench near the cable station and perform while lying face up on the bench</p>

                <ol>
                  <li>Attach stirrup handles to the high pulleys of a cable crossover machine.</li>

                  <li>Take one in each hand â€“ your arms should be outstretched with a slight bend at the elbow.</li>
                  
                  <li>Place one foot slightly forward, brace you core, and pull the handles slightly downward and across your body until your hands meet, then return to the start position.</li>

                <h2>Machine Fly/ Pec dec</h2>
                <img src="https://cdn.muscleandstrength.com/sites/default/files/machine-fly.jpg" width="400" height="300">
                <p>The pec dec is an awesome machine for targeting the pectorals, but you need to use strict technique and focus on stretch and contraction to get the most out of it. Don't let the stack drop during the set. </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The pec dec is a great machine for isolating the chest. Before you start, adjust the seat height so that the bottom of the arm pads are about level with your chest when you're sitting on the machine </li>

                    <li>Select the weight you want to use on the stack.</li>

                    <li>Sit on the machine, grasp the handles and/or place your forearms on the padding. Take the weight off the stack slightly. This is the starting position for the exercise.</li>
 
                    <li>Keeping your body fixed, slowly bring the forearm pads or handles together. Don't let them touch</li>

                    <li>Squeeze the chest muscles for a count of 1-3, then slowly lower back to the starting position.</li>
                    
                    <li>Repeat for desired reps.</li>
                </ol>
