                <ol>
                    <li>Stand with your feet more than shoulder-width apart and hold a barbell across your upper back with an overhand grip - avoid resting it on your neck. Hug the bar into your traps to engage your upper back muscles</li>
                    
                    <li>Slowly sit back into a squat with head up, back straight and backside out. Lower until your hips are aligned with your knees, with your legs at 90 degrees - a deeper squat will beneficial but focus on form first.</li>
                    
                    <li>Drive your heels into the floor to push yourself explosively back up. Keep form until youre stood up straight: 1 rep.</li>
